# gm/ga, I'm Chris!

I'm a **community taught developer**, a **tech enthusiast**, and **inspired by Web3** who strongly believes in lifelong learning to level up. A close second to coding is my passion as a **foodie**. I love tasting the masterpieces created by anyone and I find joy in using my creativity in the kitchen to cook my own version of it.  

###### I'm open to connect with anyone who is along the same dev journey or if you find anything I can contribute to I'll be glad to bring in my past industry experiences from the Healthcare, Finance/Accounting, and Media audience measurement fields.
