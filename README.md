# gm/gm, I'm Chris!

I'm a **community taught developer**, a **tech enthusiast**, and **inspired by Web3** who strongly believes in lifelong learning to level up üèÜ.  I'm open to connect with anyone who is along the same dev journey or if you find anything I can contribute to I'll be glad to bring in my past experiences from the Healthcare, Finance/Accounting, and Media audience measurement industries.
